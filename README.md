Silverfox is a Mozilla Firefox **115ESR** theme that mimicks the look and feel of 2012 Google Chrome (or Chromium). Silverfox's project name is derived from chrome's silver color.

## Welcome closed beta testers!

As a tester you have a responsability to test how Silverfox functions and looks in different situations. **Also please note, closed beta means closed! As a result please refrain from sharing to anybody that is not part of closed beta, any of SilverFox's files (regardless if they are trusted members)! People sharing Silverfox (or code from it) will be banned and lose trust/access to any future beta Silverfox releases! You can share videos or photos of Silverfox in action freely, as long as it doesn't include visible code blocks.**

Closed beta members, you have been provided with the closed beta website directly built in to your Silverfox. Once closed beta is done, it will be removed from it. That site will function as a message board. Please double click Silverfox which shows the development status and available bools.

## How to install Silverfox?
